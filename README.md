# Landmark-Classification-and-Tagging-for-Social-Media

Developing a machine learning end-to-end process: performing data preprocessing, designing and training CNNs, comparing the accuracy of different CNNs, and deploying an app based on the best trained CNN model.

# Project steps
# 1
Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch) - Visualize the dataset, process it for training, and then build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify the landmarks. Describe some of the decisions around data processing and how to chose the network architecture. Finally export the best network using Torch Script.

# 2
Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning) - Investigate different pre-trained models and decide on one to use for this classification task. Along with training and testing this transfer-learned network,and then export the best transfer learning solution using Torch Script

# 3
Deploy the algorithm in an app - Finally, I will use the best model to create a simple app for others to be able to use my model to find the most likely landmarks depicted in an image. 

# The demo application can be seen via the Googlecolab Link!!!
